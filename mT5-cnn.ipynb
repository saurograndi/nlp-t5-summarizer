The driver, Jerry Lin, 24, can be seen in the footage released by authorities, crossing several lanes and then suddenly swerving, just missing the parked cruiser that had its emergency lights flashing. 'He was apparently confused with his GPS device. It was a rental car, and he was confused about trying to get the car back to where it belonged,' state police Captain Thomas Reney said of Lin. Scroll down for video . Close call: The shocking moment an out-of-control car, right, veered into closed lanes in a Boston tunnel and narrowly missed a state police cruiser, left, has been caught on tape . 'He was paying more attention to the GPS than the lane closures.' The . motorist has been cited for negligent driving for the October 7 . incident, as GPS isn't covered by the ban on texting, video and Internet . devices. He was also for speeding and a marked lanes violation, the Boston Herald reported. Flashing lights: The driver, Jerry Lin, 24, can be seen in the footage released by authorities, crossing several lanes and then suddenly swerving, just missing the parked cruiser that had its emergency lights flashing . After he cleared the cruiser, by a . matter of inches, Lin can be seen on the video, captured by a camera in . the Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel, striking a traffic cone and it sliding . erratically from one lane to another before he managed to regain . control and the trooper took off after him. Since it was posted online on Monday, the video has racked up hundreds of thousands of views. Lin, who was returning from a friend's house, admitted he was in the wrong. Swerving: The shocked driver, shown in the distance, is then seen swerving all over the road . Chase: The trooper, pictured, then makes chase, quickly catching the driver and citing him . 'I was distracted by my GPS. I wasn't really paying attention to my speed. I was just trying to get home. I took my eyes off for a second to look where I was going,' Lin told the Herald. He said he stepped on the brake when he saw the police car. 'The next thing you know I lost control of the car and, as you saw in the video, I started swerving.''\n",
